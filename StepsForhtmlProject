1. Create a sample html file as index.html.
2. Crete a Dockerfile which use nginx as base image and copy index.html file to nginx default directory and expose port 80.
3. Build the Dockerfile using below cmd
        docker build -t satya-html-app .
4. It will create a image.
5. Tag the created image with buildid and Push to Dockerhub private repo.
6. Here we are defining DOCKER_CREDENTIALS_ID in Manage Jenkins -> Credentils -> System -> GlobalCredentials -> Add Credentials( Refer DockerhubCredentials.png).
7. Create a Pod and Service for your html app( Refer htmlpod.yml and htmlservice.yml )
8. Push all your changes to Github
9. Create a Jenkins Pipeline to pull changes from github -> Build the Dockerfile -> Push the Image to Docker hub with current Build id -> Deploy to Kubernetes (Refer Jenkinsfile)
10. Make sure you are cleaning up the resources post your successful run.
